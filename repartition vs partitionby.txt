while repartition() and partitionBy() might seem similar, they serve different purposes. 
repartition() is about how the data is distributed across partitions in memory during computation, 
while partitionBy() is about how the data is partitioned on disk when writing out to a file system.

Repartitioning can be useful for improving performance in Spark applications by controlling the distribution of data across the cluster and ensuring that data is evenly distributed across partitions.
